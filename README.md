 MushCafe Website


How It Works
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or right-click → open with browser).  
2. Navigate through the sticky **navbar** to jump to sections.  
3. **Menu & Services**: Lists display café items with neat hover effects.  
4. **Gallery**: Photos scale responsively with hover zoom effects.  
5. **Footer**: Provides contact details and copyright.
6. **our services**: information available about the Mushcafe.

Responsive Design
- Uses **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for layout.  
- Images scale with percentages (`max-width: 100%`).  
- Website adapts automatically to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.


Styling Highlights
- **Colors**: Rich reds (`#b71c1c`, `#d32f2f`) + soft cream background (`#fff8e1`).  
- **Typography**: `'Segoe UI', Arial, sans-serif` for readability.  
- **Interactivity**: Hover transitions, box shadows, and smooth animations.  


How to Run Locally
1. Download or clone the project.  
2. Extract the `.zip` file.  
3. Open `index.html` in any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
